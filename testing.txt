Yiwen Wang Homework 11 Test Plan
==========================================

class board_cell:
    tested the constructor, the parameters passed in are set properly. 
    for this class did not find any bugs while testing.
    
class Checker:
    constructor: the parameters passed in are set properly. 
    update(): 
        valid inputs: a display method, tested by checking whether the checker is showing properly. 
    move(): 
        valid inputs: tested by draging the checker with mouse, the checker should be able to be moved. 
    is_king(): 
        valid inputs: placed the checker to the cell where the checker can turn to a king, the checker then gets a crown. 
        invalid inputs: The checker is placed in a cell where it should not turn to a king, the checker did not get a crown.
    set_to_king(): same as the above method.
    for this class did not find any bugs while testing.

class chess_board:
    constructor: the parameters passed in are set properly. 
    update(): 
        valid inputs: a display method, checked if the board and checkers are showing properly
    move_checker(): 
        valid inputs: the checker can be placed in the achievable cells, cannot be placed in other cells.
    achievable(): this method can be test together with the method above.
    can_move(): this method will be tested when the logic of the game is done. Basically check if a player wins when the other player cannot move any checkers.
    king(): 
        valid inputs: when the checker was place in a cell that it should turn to a king, it turned to a king. 
        invalid inputs: when the checker was placed in a cell that it should not turn to a king, it did not turn to a king. 
    place_checker(): 
        valid inputs: when the checker was placed on a achievable cell, it stayed. 
        invalid inputs: when the checker was placed on a not achievable cell, it returned to the cell where it was from.
    is_valid_move(): this method was tested together with the method above.
    pixel_to_index():
        valid inputs: the checker was grabbed by the mouse successfully. 
    pick_checker():
        valid inputs: the checker was grabbed by the mouse successfully. 
    find_checker_at_pos():
        valid inputs: the checker was grabbed by the mouse successfully. 
    for this class the crown was showing in a wrong position comparing to the checker, so fixed it by changing the coordinates of the crown.

class GameController:
    constructor: the parameters passed in are set properly. 
    update(): tested with chess_board.update()

    place_checker(): tested with chess_board.place_checker()

    pick_checker(): tested with chess_board.pick_checker()

class GameManager():
    this class will have the logic of the game, will test the methos when HW12 is done.
